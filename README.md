# Abstract
---
### 1. To verify your visualization is correct
### 2. Pocessing raw data from rosbag files
### 3. Annotate data
### 4. Convert format of annotated data into KITTI format
### 5. Visualize result


# Visualization Tool
----
* To use visualization tool to verify you can correctly show the sence(images, point clouds) and ground truth box based on KITTI dataset cause we finally would convert our json file into KITTI label format

* [Detail in my another repo](https://github.com/s56207824inc/self-driving_visualization_ROS/tree/master)

# Extract raw data from rosbag
---

#### only testing on Velodyne HDL-32E, Ouster-128

### warning : 
* Velodyne point cloud should be reshape into (-1, 4)
* Ouster point cloud should be reshape inot (-1,9)

# Annotated data
---
### [Label toolbox](https://github.com/ziliHarvey/smart-annotation-pointrcnn)

#### only can load 50 files a time to label
#### format of result file is json


# Convert format into KITTI label
---
```
python json2kitti_camera.py --config /PATH/to/your/intrics and extrics dir --json PATH/to/json_dir --kitti PATH/to/output_dir

```

# To see your label result is correct or not
